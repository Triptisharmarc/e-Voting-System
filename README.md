# e-Voting-System

Developed an e-voting system that works similar to the EVMs used in national elections in india.
Majorly the code is written in Java. The project was developed on NetBeans. For frontend basic java was used and for development of backend JDBC was taken into use.

For DBMS, I have used derby.
